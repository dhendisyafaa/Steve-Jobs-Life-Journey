                            shifted to Mountain View, California. Even as a little kid, Steve showed immense curiosity
                            towards electronics and machines. <br> Paul Jobs was a machinist and had a garage of his own
                            where the father and son used to quench their thirst about experimenting and reconstructing
                            the electronics.</p>

                        As Jobs was completing his school project and needed some parts to finally assemble it,
                        courageously he asked for them to the president of Hewlett-Packard. Amazed by his bold and brave
                        step, William Hewlett provided him with the parts along with an internship offer at the company.
                        After the high-school phase of Steve Jobs Education, another crucial milestone came into his
                        life when he went to Poland to join the Reed College. Not finding any interest in his
                        undergraduate studies, Jobs decided to drop out of college and take those classes which he found
                        himself inclined towards. He attended calligraphy classes and spent nights at the dorms of his
                        friends.

                        back to Atari a Buddhist becoming more focused and somewhere grasping his hold on the questions
                        inside him.
